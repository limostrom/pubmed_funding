# Corporate- and NIH-Funded Health Publications

These are the necessary codes for writing a short paper about the Corporate-funded and NIH-funded publications in PubMed, and the relationship between publications and disease burden.

It makes use of 3 data sources:
	. PubMed, for publications by journal and topic
		. https://dataguide.nlm.nih.gov/edirect/esearch.html
		. Note: A new version of the PubMed API is under development, so the scraping codes may need to be adapted when it's finished
	. Web of Science, for funding information and number of citations
		. https://www.library.hbs.edu/find/databases/web-of-science
	. Global Health Data Exchange, for disease burden
		. http://ghdx.healthdata.org/gbd-results-tool
