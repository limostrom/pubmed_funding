# Corporate- and NIH-Funded Health Publications
## Amitabh Chandra, Lauren Mostrom

These are the necessary codes for writing a short paper about the Corporate-funded and NIH-funded publications in PubMed, and the relationship between publications and disease burden.

It makes use of 3 data sources:  
      * PubMed, for publications by journal and topic (https://dataguide.nlm.nih.gov/edirect/esearch.html)  
      * Web of Science, for funding information and number of citations (https://www.library.hbs.edu/find/databases/web-of-science)  
      * Global Health Data Exchange, for disease burden (http://ghdx.healthdata.org/gbd-results-tool)  

### Notable Abbreviations
